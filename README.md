# U.S. Census Data Analysis: Insights into Income and Demographics

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on U.S. Census data. The goal was to uncover insights into the relationships between average income and demographic factors such as the proportion of women in each state.

## Key Tasks and Responsibilities

- **Data Inspection and Visualization**
  - Created initial visualizations to understand the distribution of data, focusing on the relationship between average income and the proportion of women per state.

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
  - Utilized Python and Pandas for data cleaning including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.
  - Employed regular expressions to reformat income data and split demographic information.

- **Advanced Data Manipulation**
  - Separated gender data into distinct columns and converted string data to numerical for accurate analysis.
  - Filled missing values using calculated estimates based on related demographic data.

- **Data Analysis through Visualization**
  - Developed scatterplots to explore the correlation between the proportion of women and average income by state, ensuring data integrity by rechecking and cleaning data as needed.

- **Comprehensive Data Review**
  - Conducted thorough checks for NaN values and duplicates in the dataset to maintain data quality.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis with Histograms**
  - Generated histograms to analyze the distribution of different races within the U.S., converting percentage strings to floats to facilitate visualization.

- **Creative Data Presentation**
  - Explored further potential of data visualization tools in Python to present compelling visual stories that underscore key insights and trends within the data.

## Final Thoughts
This project not only improved my skills in data manipulation and visualization using Python and Pandas but also provided valuable insights into how demographic factors can influence economic metrics such as income. These analyses can help guide policy decisions and business strategies.
